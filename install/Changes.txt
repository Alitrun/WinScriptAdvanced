v.1.7	27 June, 2016
***
  Script Unification, for scripts that work directly with an exe interpreter - AHK, PHP, Autoit:  
  Now you do not need to print values of "content" variables to the console stdOut from your script code. 
  (Plugin will generate and add these strings). 
  So delete this strings from the end of your scripts (plugin will work correctly with these strings).

***
  Added 2 new params for ExeScriptParsers section: 
  StdOutFormat and CmdArgs
  E.g.: au3=c:\Program Files (x86)\AutoIt3\AutoIt3.exe
	au3CmdArgs=ExeArgs
	au3StdOutFormat=ConsoleWrite ($%s & @CRLF) 
  Read info in options.ini
